# Color_Flipper-BgMode-_Javascript_Miniproject
 This straightforward color flipper project uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  The project consists of a webpage with many mode buttons that change the page's background color when a user clicks on them.  Control flow statements, DOM methods, and a parameterize function are used to prevent code repetition and extra lines of code.
